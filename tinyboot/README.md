# tinyboot

Part of the [tinyboot](https://github.com/OpenServoCore/tinyboot) project — see the main README to get started.

Platform-agnostic bootloader core: protocol dispatcher, boot state machine, and app validation.

## Boot State Machine

Three states, encoded as contiguous 1-bit runs for cheap forward transitions (1→0 bit clear):

```
Idle (0xFF) → Updating (0x7F) → Validating (0x3F) → Idle (0xFF)
```

### State Transition Table

| Operation    | Current State | Next State   | Gate                            | Persistence                                | How                                            |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Erase**    | Idle          | Updating     | addr/size valid                 | step down state byte                       | Normal start of firmware update                |
| **Erase**    | Updating      | Updating     | addr/size valid                 | none                                       | Subsequent erase pages during update           |
| **Erase**    | Validating    | Updating     | addr/size valid                 | refresh (state=Updating, clear checksum)   | App failed to confirm, reflashing              |
| **Write**    | Idle          | reject       |                                 |                                            | Bug in host tool, no erase first               |
| **Write**    | Updating      | Updating     | addr/size valid                 | none                                       | Normal firmware write during update            |
| **Write**    | Validating    | reject       |                                 |                                            | Bug in host tool                               |
| **Verify**   | Idle          | reject       |                                 |                                            | Bug in host tool, no erase/write first         |
| **Verify**   | Updating      | Validating   | CRC match                       | refresh (state=Validating, write checksum) | Normal end of firmware write                   |
| **Verify**   | Validating    | reject       |                                 |                                            | Bug in host tool, double verify                |
| **Confirm**  | Idle          | Idle         |                                 | none                                       | App confirms after already confirmed, harmless |
| **Confirm**  | Updating      | reject       |                                 |                                            | Bug in app, update in progress                 |
| **Confirm**  | Validating    | Idle         | app is alive                    | refresh (state=Idle, preserve checksum)    | Normal app startup, confirms boot              |
| **Boot app** | Idle          | (boot)       | validate_app passes             | none                                       | Normal power-on, app is valid                  |
| **Boot app** | Updating      | (bootloader) |                                 | none                                       | Update was interrupted, resume                 |
| **Boot app** | Validating    | (boot)       | validate_app passes, has trials | step down trials byte                      | Trial boot after verify, testing new firmware  |

### Persistence

- **Step down**: 1→0 bit clear on a single OB byte. Cheap, no erase needed.
- **Refresh**: Full OB erase + rewrite. Required when setting bits from 0→1 or writing new metadata (checksum).
- **None**: State doesn't change, no OB write needed.

### Metadata (stored in option bytes)

| Field    | OB Offset | Description                                  |
| -------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| State    | +0        | Boot lifecycle state (0xFF/0x7F/0x3F)        |
| Trials   | +2        | Trial boot counter, each boot clears one bit |
| Checksum | +4,+6     | CRC16 of application firmware                |
| App Size | +8..+14   | Firmware size in bytes (u32)                 |
